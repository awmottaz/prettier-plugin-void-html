## Running tests

This project uses the native [Node.js test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) with [`node:assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html). Make sure you use a compatible version of Node.js in order to be able to run these.

The tests are all contained in the `test.js` file. Run them with `npm run test`.

## File structure

This is about as simple as it gets.

- `prettier-plugin-void-html.js` implements the plugin. See the [Prettier documentation for plugins](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins#developing-plugins).
